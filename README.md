#ver1.0：Project Description
This project develops a gesture interaction control system based on computer vision, using OpenCV and MediaPipe to capture user gesture movements in real time. It realizes two interactive applications:
1.Gesture Drawing Board: Real-time drawing on the screen through finger movements, supporting gesture switching between pen and eraser functions.
2.Gesture-Controlled Paddle Game: Controlling the paddle movement with gestures to achieve an immersive ball game experience.
